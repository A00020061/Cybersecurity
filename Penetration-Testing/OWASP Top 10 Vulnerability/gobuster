Gobuster is a tool commonly used for web application and directory brute-forcing. Its primary purpose is to discover 
hidden paths, directories, and files on a web server. 

Directory Enumeration: Gobuster helps identify directories or folders on a web server that may not be linked from 
the main website pages but still exist and may contain sensitive information.

File Discovery: It can be used to discover files that are not directly linked but may still be accessible on the 
web server.

Security Assessments: Gobuster is commonly used in penetration testing and security assessments to identify potential 
attack vectors and vulnerabilities in web applications.

Content Discovery: By finding hidden paths, Gobuster helps security professionals and developers ensure that all sensitive 
or unnecessary content is properly secured or removed.

Wildcard Analysis: Gobuster can be used to analyze wildcard configurations on web servers, helping to understand how 
the server handles non-existent paths.


Commands:
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,css,js,
py,sh,php -t 100

-t 100 => Helps speed up the scanning progress.
