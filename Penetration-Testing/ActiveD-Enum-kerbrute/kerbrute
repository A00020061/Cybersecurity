=> Microsoft Windows Kerberos is an authentication protocol used in Windows environment to verify the identities
of users or services attempting to access resources within a network.

Here's how it works:

Authentication: When a user or service attempts to access a resource (like files, printers, or applications) on a network, they provide their credentials to prove their identity.

Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT): Upon successful authentication, the Key Distribution Center (KDC) issues the user or service a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which serves as proof of authentication.

Service Ticket: When the user or service wants to access a specific resource, they request a Service Ticket from the KDC. The KDC verifies the TGT and issues a Service Ticket for the requested resource.

Authorization: The user or service presents the Service Ticket to the resource they want to access. If the ticket is valid, the resource grants access.

Examples: File sharing, print services, email services, and database access. 


------------------Kerbrute-----------------------------------------------------
Kerbrute is a tool used for performing Kerberos-based brute force attacks. It is typically used to 
test the security of Active Directory environments by attempting to guess users's passwords through
brute force attacks against the kerberos protocol.

Briefly: It is used to enumerate username by exploiting kerberos authentication.


Commands:

Can download the binary files from github.

kali> sudo ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 --help

Available Commands:
1: bruteforce=>Bruteforce username:password combos
2: Bruteuser=> Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
3: userenum=> Enumerate valid domain usernames via kerberos
4: passwordspray=> Test a single password against a list of users

kali> sudo ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d service.local ./user.txt --dc 10.10.135.182

--dc: Specifies the IP address of the domain controller to target.
-d: Specifies the name of the target domain.
-users: Specifies a list of usernames of enumerate. This could be a file containing a list of usernames
or a single username.
