Passive reconnaissance is the technique gathers information without interacting with target. Some people also refer to this
as open-source intelligence (OSINT). All of the information comes from third-party sources who have already gathered
the information about our target.

The information you gather in this stage depends upon the target. If the target is a website, you want to know as much
about the technologies behind the web site as possible. If the target is a domain, you want to know as much about the domain as possible.

1: Google dorking (allinurl, allintitle, allintext, site, filetype, and more)
2: Netcraft (Track data about web server and websites)
3: Shodan 
4: DNS (dig and dnsenum commands)
example: 'dig softcodings.com nm mx'
'dnsenum softcodings.com'
5: p0f (passive operating system detection)
example:' p0f -i eth0' wait for target operating system information.  
6: whois (whois facebook.com)



Shodan: Shodan is a different type of search engine. Instead of crawling all thw world's web pages and indexing the informatio0n
on those pages for search, shodan crawls the internet and pulls the banners on web servers, then indexes the information found in those banners.
