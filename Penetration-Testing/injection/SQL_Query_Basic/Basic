=> How to combine two table into one horizontally with a single query with a 'JOIN'

--------------------Game Table--------------------

id	mdate	stadium	team1	team2
1001	8 June 2012	National Stadium, Warsaw	POL	GRE
1002	8 June 2012	Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)	RUS	CZE
1003	12 June 2012	Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)	GRE	CZE

-------------------Goal Table --------------------

matchid	teamid	player	gtime
1001	POL	Robert Lewandowski	17
1001	GRE	Dimitris Salpingidis	51
1002	RUS	Alan Dzagoev	15
1002	RUS	Roman Pavlyuchenko	82
