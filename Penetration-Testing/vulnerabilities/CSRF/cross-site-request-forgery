CSRF is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to p[artly circumvent the same origin policy
, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.

For example: This is might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to 
gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role withi8n the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's 
data and functionality.
