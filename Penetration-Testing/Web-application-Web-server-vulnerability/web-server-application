Web Application Vulnerability Analysis:

Focus: This type of analysis concentrates on identifying vulnerabilities specific to web applications running on a server.
Scope: It includes the assessment of the application layer, which involves examining the web application's code, user inputs, authentication mechanisms, and functionality.

Examples of Vulnerabilities: SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), security misconfigurations in application settings, and other issues 

directly related to the application's logic and behavior.

Tools: Web application vulnerability scanners like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and automated testing tools that focus on application-level security.

2. Web Server Vulnerability Analysis:

Focus: This analysis is concerned with vulnerabilities present in the web server software and its configuration.

Scope: It involves examining the server environment, including the operating system, server software, network configurations, and services running on the server.

Examples of Vulnerabilities: Outdated server software, misconfigured server settings, insecure file permissions, open ports, and vulnerabilities associated with the server operating system.

Tools: Web server vulnerability scanners like Nikto, Nessus, and manual testing methods to assess server configurations and security.

In summary, while web application vulnerability analysis focuses on issues within the web application itself, web server vulnerability analysis looks at the broader infrastructure 
supporting the web application. Both are crucial components of a comprehensive security assessment, and addressing vulnerabilities at both levels is essential for securing web-based 
systems effectively. Often, security professionals perform both types of analyses to ensure a thorough evaluation of a web environment's security posture.
