/usr/local/sbin: specific to the local system and are not provided by OS.
/usr/local/bin: Contains executable files but is generally used for commands available to all users.
/usr/sbin: Holds system administrator commands are not essential for normal system operation. Used for maintenance and troubleshooting tasks.
/usr/bin: Most user commands and utilities installed by the operating system's package manager are located here.
/sbin: similar to '/usr/sbin'
/bin: system commands required for booting the system and basic system operations are stored 

when you type 'ls' into the terminal, the system will search for an executable file named 'ls' in each directory listed in the $PATH variable
