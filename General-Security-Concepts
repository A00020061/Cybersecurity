-----------------Port-Forwarding---------
Port-forwarding: Port forwarding is a technique used in computer networking to allow traffic from outside a network to reach a specific service or application within the network. It's like rerouting traffic coming to your home to a specific room inside. Imagine you work for RAA and need to access the internal administration panel of the RAA's application or servers from a remote location (such as from home or while traveling). Companies that host their own private servers for services like email, website hosting, or other internal applications often utilize port forwarding. It allows external users to access these services securely by directing incoming traffic from the internet to the specific servers or devices within the company's private network.
