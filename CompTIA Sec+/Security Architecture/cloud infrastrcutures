Serverless Architecture

1. Event-Driven Execution:
Functions are triggered by specific events (HTTP requests, database changes) rather than continuously running servers.
2. Auto-Scaling:
Automatically adjusts resources based on demand, scaling up or down as needed, ensuring efficient resource utilizatio3. Pay-Per-Use Model:
Cost is based on actual usage rather than fixed server uptime, making it cost-effective for variable workloads.
4. Managed Infrastructure:
Cloud providers manage servers, runtime, scaling, and maintenance, reducing operational overhead for developers.
5. Statelessness:
Functions are stateless, meaning they don't retain data between executions, enhancing scalability and reliability.
6. Microservices Approach:
Applications are broken into smaller, independent functions, fostering modularity and easier maintenance.
7. Third-Party Service Integration:
Utilizes various cloud services and APIs for tasks like database storage, authentication, and notifications.
8. Cold Starts:
Initialization delay when invoking a function that's been idle, impacting response times for infrequently accessed functions.
9. Monitoring and Debugging:
Requires specialized tools for monitoring function performance, error handling, and debugging in a distributed environment.
10. Dependency Management:
