=> What is Security Zone and how different from Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)?
A 'security zone' in the context of network and information security is a segment of a network that is defined and enforeced by security policies, tools, and procedures. It is a way to control access and monitor activities within
a specific area of a organization's network. Security zones are crucial for managing and mitigating risks associated with networked systems and data.

Why we need Security Zones: 
1: Risk Management, Data Protection, Threat Isolation, monitoring and detection, and access control.


Demilitarized Zone is a middle ground between the internet (external network) and the internal network of a company or organization. It's designed to host services that need to be accessed by the outside world, like web servers, email servers,
sometimes VPN gateways. This zone adds an extra layer of security by keeeping these external-facing services separate from the more sensitive internal network.


Which of the following best defines a security zone in a network context?
A) A physical barrier securing server rooms
@B) A segment of a network with specific security measures and policies
C) A type of firewall used for external network protection
D) A protocol for securing wireless networks

What is the primary purpose of a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in a network architecture?
A) To provide a highly secure area for sensitive data
@B) To isolate internal network resources from external threats
C) To enable unrestricted access to all network services
D) To host internal databases and applications

Which of the following is a key advantage of implementing security zones in a network?
A) Simplified network architecture
B) Increased vulnerability to external threats
@C) Enhanced risk management and containment
D) Reduced need for encryption protocols

What distinguishes a Security Zone from a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in a network setup?
A) The use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
B) The presence of firewalls
C) The specific focus on external threats
@D) The broader application beyond internal-external separation

In a corporate network, which zone typically hosts services like web servers and email servers accessible from the internet?
A) Internal Zone
B) Secure Zone
C) Restricted Zone
@D) Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
