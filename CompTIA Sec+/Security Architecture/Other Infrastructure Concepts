=> Embedded Systems:
Embedded systems are specialized computer systems that are designed to perform specific functions or tasks, often as part of a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computers liek laptops or desktops, embedded systems are typically
designed for a particular applications or functions and are integrated into other devices.

Example: A washing Machine |Digital watches | Traffic Light Controllers | Microwave | Airbag in automobile etc.

=>What is Real-time Operating System (RTOS)?

RTOS is a specialized operating systems designed to manage hardware resources and run software applications in predictable and time-constrained environment. Unlike general-purpose operating sytems (like Windows or Linux) which are 
designed for multitaksing and user convenience, RTOSs are engineered for applications that require a high degree of reliability and precision in timing.

Example: Airbag system of a car, the airbag must deploy within a specified timer after a collision is detected. Moreover, Spaceship, Missiles, and Robots etc.

=What is SCADA System?
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acqisition,used for controlling and monitoring industrial processes. SCADA systems are crucial for industrial organizations as they help to maintain efficiency, process data for smarter
decisions, and communicate system issues to help mititage downtime. 

SCADA's components => sensors (for controlling and monitoring field devices), RTU (Remote Terminal Unit is used to grab and send data from sensors to SCADA server via network), SCADA server, SCADA dashboard.
Example: Power Plant, Gas Refining, Transpotation, Telecommunication, and Water Plant.

Why we need SCADA System: Early detection of problems, analysis for better decision-making, and enhanced process automation. 

=> Why we need Embedded Systems:
1: Efficiency and Specialization (Because they are tailored for specific tasks)
2: Size and cost (Usually smaller and less expensive than full-fledged computers)
3: Reliability and Stability
4: Real-time Operations (Many embedded systems operate in real-time, meaning they can process data and respond to inputs immediately like airbag systems in cars)
5: Energy Efficiency (Typically consume less power)

--------------CompTIA Security+ Questions list--------------
1: Which security measure is crucial for securing IoT devices that heavily rely on embedded systems?"
A) Firmware updates
B) Network segmentation
C) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
D) Physical access control

Correct Answer: A) Firmware updates
Explanation: Regular firmware updates are crucial for IoT devices to patch vulnerabilities and enhance security features.

2: What is a key consideration for secure coding in embedded systems?"
A) Code obfuscation
B) Minimizing resource usage
C) Maximizing hardware performance
D) Incorporating backdoors for debugging

Correct Answer: B) Minimizing resource usage
Explanation: Embedded systems often have limited resources (like memory and processing power), so it's important to write efficient code that minimizes resource usage.

3: Which security feature helps in verifying the integrity of embedded system firmware during boot-up?"
A) Secure Enclave
B) TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
C) BIOS passwords
D) Remote attestation

Correct Answer: B) TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
Explanation: A TPM can be used to ensure the integrity of firmware by providing secure storage for cryptographic keys and performing hardware-based verification during the boot process.

4: Which protocol is commonly used for securing communications in IoT devices with embedded systems?"
A) MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
B) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
C) SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
D) HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

Correct Answer: A) MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
Explanation: MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT devices for secure and efficient communication.

5: Which attack targets vulnerabilities in embedded systems by overloading input buffers?"
A) SQL Injection
B) Buffer Overflow
C) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
D) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Correct Answer: B) Buffer Overflow
Explanation: A buffer overflow attack occurs when more data is input into a buffer than it can handle, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the system's memory.

6: The secure boot process in an embedded system is designed to prevent which of the following?
A) Data corruption due to power failures
B) Unauthorized modification of the boot sequence
C) Overheating of the CPU
D) Slowdown due to fragmented memory

Correct Answer: B

7: Which is a common method to secure data transmission in networked embedded systems?
A) Data compression
B) Using SSL/TLS protocols
C) Increasing bandwidth
D) Physical isolation of networks

Correct Answer: B

8: Which of the following is a common security threat specifically concerning SCADA systems?
A) Phishing emails
B) SQL injection attacks
C) Unauthorized remote access
D) Adware

Correct Answer: C) Unauthorized remote access
Explanation: Unauthorized remote access is a significant threat to SCADA systems because they often control critical infrastructure and industrial processes. Gaining unauthorized access can lead to manipulation of control systems, 
potentially causing widespread disruptions.

9: What is a critical security measure for protecting SCADA networks?
A) Regular password changes
B) Using a firewall
C) Frequent software updates
D) All of the above

Correct Answer: D) All of the above
Explanation: Securing SCADA networks involves multiple layers of security. Regular password changes prevent unauthorized access, firewalls protect against external threats, and frequent software updates address vulnerabilities.

10:  Which factor is crucial when considering the security of SCADA communication protocols?
A) Speed of data transmission
B) Encryption of data
C) Protocol popularity
D) Ease of implementation

Correct Answer: B) Encryption of data
Explanation: The security of communication protocols in SCADA systems is vital, and encryption is key to protecting data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. It helps prevent interception and manipulation of critical 
operational data.
