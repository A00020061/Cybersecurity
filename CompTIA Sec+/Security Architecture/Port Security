=> What is Extensible Authenticaion Protocol?
EAP provides a secure and extensible frame work for authenticating users and devices on networks, allowing diverse
and flexible authentication methods while maintaining strong security.

=> How does EAP work?
EAP uses the 802.1x standard as its authentication mechanism over a local area network or a wireless LAN. 
Key feature: 
=>Three-party model:
Supplicant: Endpoint like laptop, desktop
Authenticator: The network device controlling access (wifi access point)
Authentication Server: The server verifying user credentials (directory server)

Methods to authenticate:
PEAP (Protected EAP): PEAP authenticates clients using server-side certificates.
EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
EAP-TTLS (Tunneled TLS): Certificate based mutual authentication.
LEAP (lightweight EAP)


Question 1

EAP is primarily designed to operate at which layer of the OSI model?

a) Data link layer
b) Network layer
c) Transport layer
d) Application layer

(Answer) d) Application layer

EAP operates at the application layer (OSI layer 7) because it deals with user authentication and data security,
which are application-level concerns.

Question 2

Which of the following is NOT a common EAP method?

a) PEAP (Protected EAP)
b) EAP-TLS (EAP with Transport Layer Security)
c) EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS)
d) PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)

(Answer) d) PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)

PAP is a simple authentication method that transmits passwords in plain text, making it insecure for use with EAP. 
The other options listed are commonly used secure EAP methods.

Question 3

What is the primary role of EAP in wireless networks?

a) To encrypt data packets
b) To manage network access points
c) To authenticate users and devices
d) To establish virtual private networks

(Answer) c) To authenticate users and devices

EAP's primary function is to verify the identity of users and devices attempting to access a network. 
While it indirectly contributes to data encryption and network management, these are not its core purposes.

Question 4

EAP typically uses a three-party model involving which entities?

a) Supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server
b) Client, server, and certificate authority
c) User, device, and network administrator
d) Access point, firewall, and intrusion detection system

(Answer) a) Supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server

EAP typically involves a three-way interaction between the supplicant (client device), the authenticator
(network access point), and the authentication server (responsible for verifying user credentials).

Question 5

Which of the following is a key advantage of EAP?

a) It supports a wide range of authentication methods.
b) It provides strong encryption for all network traffic.
c) It is immune to denial-of-service attacks.
d) It does not require any configuration on client devices.

(Answer) a) It supports a wide range of authentication methods.

Which EAP method relies on a one-time password (OTP) generated by a software token or hardware authenticator for secure authentication?
a) PEAP (Protected EAP)
=>b) LEAP (Lightweight EAP)
c) EAP-TLS (EAP with Transport Layer Security)
d) EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS)

LEAP is the method that relies on one-time passwords for secure authentications.

True or False: EAP-MD5 (EAP with Message Digest 5) is considered a secure option for network authentication due to its strong hashing algorithm.
a) True
=>b) False

A company prioritizes confidentiality and integrity of user credentials during the authentication process. Which EAP method would be most suitable for achieving these goals?
=>a) EAP-FAST (EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
b) EAP-SIM (EAP with Subscriber Identity Module)
c) EAP-AKA (EAP with Authentication and Key Agreement)
d) EAP-SHA256 (EAP with Secure Hash Algorithm 256)

Its secure tunneling and mutual authentication features. 

For secure wireless network access in an organization, what is the recommended order of implementing EAP methods?
a) PEAP first, then EAP-TLS
b) LEAP first, then EAP-MD5
=>c) EAP-TLS first, then PEAP
d) EAP-TTLS first, then EAP-SHA256

Prioritizing stronger security offered by EAP-TLS while still allowing for PEAP fallback.

Which of the following statements is NOT a potential vulnerability associated with EAP-TTLS?
a) Man-in-the-middle attacks if network infrastructure is not properly secured
=>b) Increased computational overhead compared to simpler EAP methods
c) Vulnerability to dictionary attacks for weak passwords used with PEAP inner authentication
d) Potential for unauthorized third-party access if server certificates are compromised
