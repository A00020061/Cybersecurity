Converting data plaintext to ciphertext (encrypted, unreadable data)
Methods: 
Symmetric encryption (single key to both encypt and decrypt data)
Asymmetric encryption (Public and Private keys to encrypt and decrypt data)
Cryptographic Algorithms: 
Symmetric (AES{Advanced Encryption Standard}, DES{Data Encryption Standard})
Asymmetric (RSA and ECC)
Purpose:
Confidentiality and Security of data
