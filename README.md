# Cybersecurity
------------------Encryption-----------
Converting data plaintext to ciphertext (encrypted, unreadable data)
Methods: 
Symmetric encryption (single key to both encypt and decrypt data)
Asymmetric encryption (Public and Private keys to encrypt and decrypt data)
Cryptographic Algorithms: 
Symmetric (AES{Advanced Encryption Standard}, DES{Data Encryption Standard})
Asymmetric (RSA and ECC)
Purpose:
Confidentiality and Security of data

Infrastructure as Code:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where you manage and provision IT infrastructure (virtual machines, networks, load balancers, etc.) using code rather than manual processes. It treats infrastructure as you would treat software: you write code to define what you want, and the code is then executed to create or modify the infrastructure.
