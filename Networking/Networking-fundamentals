-----------------Components of Reliable Networks (Fault tolerance, Quality of Service, Scalability, and Security)---------------
1: Fault tolerance=> Network should depend on multiple network data. If one path fail, the message (data packet) are instantly sent over a different link.
2: Scalability=> A scalability network expands quickly to support new users and applications. It does without disgrading the performance of service.
3: Quality of Service=> When the volume of traffic is grater than what can be transported across the network, device will hold the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them.
Quality of service managed by the router ensures that priorities are mentioned with the type of communication and tis importance to the organisation.
4: Security=> Consist of three components ( Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical address => MAC address
Logical address => IP4/IP6 address
----------------------------Hierarchical Network Design------------------------------------------------
1: Core Layer=> Bacbone layer with backup connections. Core layer devices typically include very powerfull, high speed switches and router.
2: Distribution Layer=> Provides a connections point for separate networks and flow of information between the networks.
3: Access Layer=> The access layer provides a connection point to end users devices to the network.
